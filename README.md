## 🧭 About the Project

**RomeWithMe** began as a personal blog during my semester abroad in Rome — but the idea behind it was born much earlier, in the hesitation, fears, and *“what ifs”* that almost stopped me from going in the first place.

The thought of leaving home to step into a new continent was intimidating. I didn’t know the language, I didn’t know the people, and I had no idea what it would feel like to suddenly be surrounded by centuries of unfamiliar culture.  
Money was also a worry — without steady income abroad, I had to save, find external funding, and plan every expense carefully. And then there was the cultural gap: what if I offended someone without meaning to, just because I didn’t understand their traditions?

RomeWithMe grew from those early reflections into a **full-featured web platform** — a place to connect, share, and empower others to experience the world confidently.  
It’s a fusion of storytelling and technology — designed, built, and deployed end-to-end as a showcase of real-world software engineering.
