    <h3>My Story</h3>
    <p>
        <span class="pl-6">RomeWithMe</span> began as a personal  blog during my semester abroad in Rome, but the idea behind it
        was born much earlier — in the hesitation, the fears, and the “what ifs” that nearly stopped
        me from going in the first place. The thought of leaving home to step into a whole new
        continent was intimidating. I didn’t know the language, I didn’t know the people, and I had
        no idea what it would feel like to suddenly be surrounded by centuries of unfamiliar culture.
        Money was also a worry — without steady income abroad, I had to save, find external funding,
        and plan every expense carefully. And then there was the cultural gap: what if I offended
        someone without meaning to, just because I didn’t understand their traditions?
    </p>

    <p>
        <span class="pl-6">When</span> I finally stepped off the plane, the weight of my fears didn’t vanish all at once, they 
        quickly began to unravel. However the strangers I met in those first days weren’t distant or unwelcoming;
        they were patient, open, and curious. Every conversation reminded me that kindness and connection 
        transcend language barriers. And then there was Rome itself: standing in a city layered with 
        thousands of years of history. I was living at the center of a big part of human civilization. 
        That perspective reshaped how I saw my own small place in the world.
    </p>

    <p>
        <span class="pl-6">Life</span> abroad didn’t come with training wheels. Independence wasn’t just about cooking or shopping,
        it was about doing all of that while navigating a new culture, a new language, and a completely
        unfamiliar system. From planning trips across countries to balancing classes with daily survival 
        tasks, every choice forced me to adapt quickly and rely on myself in ways I never had to back home.
        That growth made me resourceful, confident, and resilient. Along the way, I built friendships that 
        crossed borders and time zones, proof that no matter how foreign a place feels at first, you can 
        always find connection.
    </p>

    <p>
        <span class="pl-6">RomeWithMe</span> was born from that transformation. I didn’t create this platform for profit or
        recognition — I created it because I believe every student should have the chance to feel what
        I felt. The world is vast, and if you have even one opportunity to step outside your comfort
        zone and see it, you should take it. My goal is simple: to encourage and support students in
        taking that leap.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
      Our mission is to build a supportive, resource-rich, and welcoming community for students who
      are curious about studying abroad. Whether you are still on the fence, planning your first
      semester overseas, or already living abroad, RomeWithMe exists to connect you with others who
      understand the journey. We aim to make studying abroad less intimidating by providing access
      to scholarships, resources, and — most importantly — the real stories of students who’ve gone
      before you.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Values</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Inclusivity:</strong> Every student, no matter their background, belongs here. We
        welcome diverse voices, experiences, and perspectives.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Adventure:</strong> We encourage bold steps into the unknown, fueled by curiosity
        and excitement.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cultural Exchange:</strong> Respecting traditions and learning from them is at the
        heart of every study abroad journey.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Growth:</strong> Beyond academics, studying abroad builds resilience, independence,
        and a global mindset.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Openness:</strong> We value honesty, vulnerability, and authentic storytelling from
        every student who shares their journey.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Our Community</h2>
    <p>
      RomeWithMe has grown from one person’s blog into a student-powered hub. Verified members can
      share their experiences through blog posts, stories, and discussions, giving future students a
      window into what studying abroad is truly like. It’s a place where you can find scholarships
      and resources, but also where you can laugh at travel mishaps, get advice on visas, or find
      friends to explore a new city with.
    </p>

    <p>
      What makes this community different is its heart. There are no hidden agendas here. RomeWithMe
      isn’t about marketing programs or selling a dream — it’s about creating a space where students
      help students. It’s about making sure that no one feels alone in their journey abroad, whether
      that journey takes them to Rome, Tokyo, Cape Town, or anywhere else in the world.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Promise</h2>
    <p>
      In the next few years, RomeWithMe will grow into a trusted home base for students studying
      abroad. Our goal is for this to be the place students check first when searching for
      scholarships, exploring program options, or just looking for encouragement from someone who’s
      been there before. We promise to keep the community supportive, safe, and focused on the
      values that started it all: inclusivity, adventure, and growth.

    <h3>A Note from the Founder</h3>
    <p>
      Hi, I’m Naeem, the creator of RomeWithMe. I started this journey because I know exactly how
      scary it feels to step into the unknown — but I also know the incredible rewards waiting on
      the other side. My hope is that through this community, more students will take the chance to
      go abroad, to explore, and to grow. Because when you see more of the world, you see more of
      yourself.
